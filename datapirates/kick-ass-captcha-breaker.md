# Description

We have a huge system constantly crawling the web and scraping useful data about companies and people.
To crawl the web on a cool automated and not ridiculously expensive way, you will need to automate
captcha breaking, and guess what ? It is exactly what we do :-), and we are in need of help to
get even better at it.

On this job you will not only research ways to break captchas, but also design and maintain the services
that exposes these APIs to our crawlers. And since we value the DevOps culture you will also be
involved on deployment of the services, and keeping them running on production.
